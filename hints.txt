- If unit A attacks unit B, then then random number is picked in range [0 A.attack+B.armor], if the result is below A.attack, then A hits random anatomy part of B. The damage inflicted is equivalent to A.health/2

- Attack out of invisibility gets +14 combat bonus to hit the target and deals 1.5 times more damage than usual attack.
- Lightning and blizzard spells affect only outdoors cells, so take cover to avoid being hit by them.
